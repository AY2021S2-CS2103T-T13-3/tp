## Project: FlashBack

FlashBack - This application will improve the performance of students via improved accessibility and organisation of
notes, together with interactive sessions that enhance memory retention.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to find flashcards by different search criteria.

    * What it does: allows the user to find flashcards matching the given keywords according to the given search
      criteria.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user may add a huge amount of flashcards
      in FlashBack which makes it difficult to search for desired flashcards, and the app should provide a way for users
      to easily search for flashcards the user wish to see.
    * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands. It required a good understand of existing code to add the
      ability of finding flashcards by different criteria. The implementation was challenging as it required changes to
      existing command and test cases.
    
* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Added documentation for the features `list` and `find`
